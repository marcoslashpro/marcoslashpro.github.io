## About Me

_Hi, I’m Marco, a software engineer who loves building intelligent systems, clean architectures, and all the engineering magic that makes smart products actually work in the real world._

_I’m obsessed with the mechanics of AI, how models reason, where they fail, and how to shape them into reliable agents. But I’m equally in love with the craft of software engineering: solid backend design, smooth frontends, CI/CD pipelines that never break, tests that give you confidence, and systems that scale without drama. And yes, I’m a math nerd at heart, which fuels how I think about algorithms, optimization, and learning systems._

_What drives me is the mix of curiosity and discipline: exploring new ideas, iterating fast, and constantly leveling up while keeping the codebase clean and the architecture sane. I like building things that feel futuristic but are grounded in thoughtful engineering._

_If you’re looking for someone who can go deep into AI, cares about quality, and actually ships, that’s me._

## _Checkout My Projects_
#### **Multimodal RAG**
People struggle to keep track of scattered documents, images, and notes — and even more to *search and reason* over them.  
Multimodal RAG solves this by letting you upload any file and interact with it intelligently, like having an agent that actually understands your content.

#### **CareerKit**
Job applications take forever — rewriting résumés, adjusting cover letters, pulling skills from old documents.  
CareerKit cuts that pain dramatically by helping you generate and refine tailored applications in real time, guided by an agent that understands your profile.

#### **DebugAgent**
Debugging is frustrating when tools only show errors without context, insight, or reasoning.  
DebugAgent aims to make debugging *collaborative* by giving developers an AI assistant that explains issues, explores possibilities, and helps you think through tricky code.
