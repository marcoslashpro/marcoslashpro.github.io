## **_About Me_**

</div>

_Hi, I’m Marco, a software engineer who loves building intelligent systems, clean architectures, and all the engineering magic that makes smart products actually work in the real world._

_I’m obsessed with the mechanics of AI, how models reason, where they fail, and how to shape them into reliable agents. But I’m equally in love with the craft of software engineering: solid backend design, smooth frontends, CI/CD pipelines that never break, tests that give you confidence, and systems that scale without drama. And yes, I’m a math nerd at heart, which fuels how I think about algorithms, optimization, and learning systems._

_What drives me is the mix of curiosity and discipline: exploring new ideas, iterating fast, and constantly leveling up while keeping the codebase clean and the architecture sane. I like building things that feel futuristic but are grounded in thoughtful engineering._

_If you’re looking for someone who can go deep into AI, cares about quality, and actually ships, that’s me._

## **_Checkout My Projects_**

</div>

#### _Multimodal RAG_
People struggle to keep track of scattered documents, images, and notes — and even more to *search and reason* over them.  
Multimodal RAG solves this by letting you upload any file and interact with it intelligently, like having an agent that actually understands your content.

#### _CareerKit_
Job applications take forever, rewriting résumés, adjusting cover letters, pulling skills from old documents.  
CareerKit cuts that pain dramatically by helping you generate and refine tailored applications in real time, guided by an agent that understands your profile.

#### _DebugAgent_
Debugging is frustrating when tools only show errors without context, insight, or reasoning.  
DebugAgent aims to make debugging *collaborative* by giving developers an AI assistant that explains issues, explores possibilities, and helps you think through tricky code.

## **_Here I Speak My Mind_**

</div>

#### _Agent Frameworks Standoff_
Everyone is building agents, but nobody fully agrees on **how** to build them.  
LLMs alone still can’t act, plan, or reason with real-world constraints, that’s why agent frameworks exploded in popularity.  
But in 2025, with so many options (LangChain, LangGraph, Pydantic-AI, AutoGen, custom orchestrators…), which one actually holds up?  
This post breaks down the trade-offs, the hidden pitfalls, and which frameworks are worth your time.

#### _Multi-Agent Document Enhancement_
How do you build a **reliable**, **consistent**, and **fast** multi-agent workflow that improves documents without introducing chaos?  
While building CareerKit, I had to solve exactly this problem, and that’s how the **Multi-Agent Document Enhancement** (MADE) system was born.  
In this post, I walk through the challenges, the architecture, the failures, and the surprising lessons from building a multi-agent system that users can trust.

#### _A Simple RL Roadmap_
LLMs are powerful, but they won’t get us to AGI on their own, the **compute–data scaling laws** are already showing cracks.  
Reinforcement Learning, on the other hand, learns through **experience**, not just next-token prediction, and does so with drastically less compute.  
From **RLHF** to **robotics**, RL opens doors that LLMs simply can’t.  
This post is a simple, practical roadmap for anyone curious about how RL works, why it matters, and where it might take us.

## **_ML & AI_**

</div>

#### _Linear Regression Vs Neural Network Standoff_
If **ML** teaches us anything, it’s that more complex $$\neq$$ better.
The real goal is almost always to find the _simplest_ model that solves the problem — the sweet spot between too naive and too fancy, often called the **Goldilocks Zone**.
In this notebook, I explore whether a basic **linear regression** model can outperform a more complex **neural network** on a small but well-engineered dataset.
The results might surprise you.

#### _Stock Predictor_
Humans are notoriously bad at long-term statistical decisions, we rely on intuition, context, and overconfidence far more than we should.
This notebook asks a simple question:  
**Can a statistical model trained on time-series data reliably outperform human judgment when predicting whether a stock will go up?**
I walk through preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, and whether a modest model can beat our cognitive biases.

#### _Implementing a DQN from scratch_
**Reinforcement Learning** is one of the most exciting areas in ML, and also one of the trickiest to implement correctly.
In this notebook, I build a **Deep Q-Network** (DQN) from the ground up:
no ChatGPT, no tutorials, just the research paper, the math, and a lot of debugging.
If you’re curious how the theory turns into an actual working agent, this notebook walks through every step.
